## Description

The project revolves around building machine learning models to detect breast cancer based on certain features derived from diagnostic tests. After cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed for classification. The accuracy of each model is evaluated and visualized to provide insights into their performance.

## Usage

The project can be accessed via Jupyter Notebook. Simply open the provided `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to view the code, execute the cells, and interact with the analysis.

## Data Source

- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

## Content

The dataset consists of various features derived from diagnostic tests, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at this [link](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/)

## Result

Achieved the highest accuracy of 97.37% in classifying Malignant and Benign Tumours with Logistic Regression.
